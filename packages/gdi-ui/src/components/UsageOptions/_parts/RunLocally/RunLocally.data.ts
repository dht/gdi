To run GDI locally on your machine, you need to prepare a directory and start the AI Runner:

\`\`\`
npx gdi init my-project
cd my-project
\`\`\`

Edit the .env file:
\`\`\`
code .env
\`\`\`


Start the AI Runner:

\`\`\`
npx gdi start
\`\`\`

Change the mode to "local" in the UI. On the bottom bar click the adapter icon (ðŸ”Œ) and switch to local mode.

That's it, you're good to go! ðŸš€
