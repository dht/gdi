An eldery couple is sitting in their living room. The husband is wearing a virtual reality headset. The wife is sitting across him, reading a book. They both have cups of tea on the table.

frank: how do I operate this thing?

merry: you spent a fortune on a gadget and you don't even know how to use it.

frank: it's the future merry, don't you want to be part of the future?

merry: why do you need a virtual reality anyway, what's wrong with the real one?

frank: have you seen the news lately?

frank: I see the room, but I don't see anything else. Is there suppose to be a button?

merry: did you turn it on?

frank: I think it's on.
