## 1. Centralized Data

All GDI apps **share a common database and asset library**. Both database and assets are provider-agnostic, meaning you can run them on your local machine. Why is this important?

### Post Information Silos Era

**ChatGPT** is changing how we weave information into knowledge. Previously, users had to sift through various sources manually to gather information and fuse it into knowledge. LLMs are revolutionizing this process by aggregating and synthesizing information seamlessly, `breaking the boundaries of traditional information silos`.

GDI takes a comparable approach to handling data and assets. Instead of dispersing a user's personal data among multiple silos on different SaaS providers, GDI allows using a singular source of truth. No more copy/pasting or exporting to move data around.

### The Beehive and the Honey

This unified data interface fosters a dynamic akin to a beehive, where the user's personal data and assets represent the honey, and all the apps, AI models, and business logic function as the bees, constantly cultivating and refining the honey.

This approach becomes paramount in the AI era, where users will continuously leverage portions of their personal data to interact with various AI models and will be unable to do so if they need to navigate multiple SaaS and closed data silos to gather the necessary bits.
