## 1. Centralized Data

All GDI apps **share a common database and asset library**. Both database and assets are provider-agnostic, meaning you can run them on your local machine. Why is this important?

### Post Information Silos Era

**ChatGPT** is changing how we weave information into knowledge. Previously, users had to sift through various sources manually to gather information and fuse it into knowledge. ChatGPT is revolutionizing this process by aggregating and synthesizing information seamlessly, `breaking the boundaries of traditional information silos`.

GDI takes a comparable approach to handling data and assets. Instead of dispersing a user's personal data among multiple silos on different SAAS providers, GDI allows using a singular source of truth. No more copy/pasting or exporting to move data around.

### The Beehive and the Honey

This unified interface fosters a dynamic akin to a beehive, where the user's personal data and assets represent the honey, and all the apps, AI models, and business logic function as the bees, constantly cultivating and refining the honey.

This approach becomes paramount in the AI era, where users will continuously leverage their data and assets to interact with AI models and apps, eliminating the need to run around multiple SaaS and data silos to gather their personal data.
