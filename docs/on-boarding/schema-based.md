## 3. Schema Based

User-interfaces and User-content have been closed in silos for years. **Interfaces are built by closed-source companies, compiled into static files and shipped while content once edited is baked into binary formats**. This rigid approach makes it difficult to evolve interfaces and content or `offer real time dynamic interfaces and content`. GDI changes this by utilizing a schema-based approach.

In GDI, nearly every entity is defined by a schema, including data, UI, and generated content. A GDI video is a JSON, not a baked binary. This schema-based approach brings the power of GIT and software evolution to both interfaces and content. Imagine watching a video on YouTube and saying, "I like this video, but I want to change the animation and add a voiceover." With GDI, you can do that. You can fork the video, change the animation, add a voiceover, and share the new version with others.

The same goes for the UI. You can fork a GDI board, change the layout, add a new widget or AI integration, and share the new version with others with a message like "improved Todo board."

All the previous examples are offline examples, but **AI can usher a new era of dynamic interfaces and content**. Imagine a video that changes based on the viewer's mood or a UI that adapts to the user's preferences. GDI is dedicated to exploring these possibilities and making them accessible to everyone.
