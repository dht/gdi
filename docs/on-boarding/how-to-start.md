## How to Start?

As a **user**, you can start by logging in, browsing the different GDI boards, and installing the ones you want to play with. Some boards have tutorials to help you get started.

As a **developer**, you can start by [running a local instance](https://github.com/dht/gdi?tab=readme-ov-file#running-a-local-instance) of GDI or creating a new board.

Join the community and contribute to the project. We are always looking for new ideas and contributors.
