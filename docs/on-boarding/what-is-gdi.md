# What is GDI?

GDI is an `app store for AI-powered apps`.

i.e. apps that interact with AI models and utilize AI-generated assets. Whether you are managing your tasks, creating 3D animations, or planning a ski trip, **GDI is set to explore the most efficient methods to achieve it with AI at your side**.

GDI apps interact with each other, complementing one another. Each app can be seen as a bee in a beehive.
