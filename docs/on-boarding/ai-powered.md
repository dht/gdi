## 2. AI-Powered

Naturally, GDI apps are `AI-powered`. They interact with AI models and use AI-generated assets.

This AI integration isn't just a feature; it's integral to the GDI ecosystem. Traditional desktop or mobile apps historically held two advantages over web apps: access to local hardware for superior performance and operation within a higher-trust environment. They could accomplish much more. **However, this paradigm shifts when web apps tap into the capabilities of AI models**. If a web app tasked with generating 3D animation can delegate the heavy lifting to a robust AI model, it can rival the performance of a desktop app. Similarly, if a web app can access a user's personal data and assets, it can offer the same robustness of a desktop app.

UX/UI solutions are needed for challenges such as asset management, API calls monitoring and orchestration, and cost optimization.

> More often than not user interfaces powered by AI require a complete overhaul of the traditional UI/UX design. GDI is set to explore the most efficient methods to achieve this.

GDI is dedicated to exploring how to extend these two advantages to web apps.
