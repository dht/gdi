# Smart Watches

Billions of people use mobile phones every day. This direct connection to the internet can be a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it gives us access to a wealth of information and services. A curse because it can be distracting and addictive.

AI technology can hold the key to regulating our relationship with technology and help us make the most of technology without suffering from its downsides.

## New Form Factors

The power of AI and LLMs makes it possible to create a new category of smaller devices that can make technology more ubiquitous and less intrusive. New conceptual products such as [Humane's AI Pin](https://hu.ma.ne/) are trying to accomplish this goal.

## Smart Watches

Smart watches are a good example of a new form factor that can benefit from AI technology. They are small, portable, and can be worn on the wrist. They can leverage AI technology to offer the same capabilities as a mobile phone without the downsides.

The combination of AI and smart watches can offer a barrier between the user and the internet. It can act as a filter that only allows the most important information to reach the user. A user can pre-configure an AI assistant according to their preferences and the AI assistant can filter the information accordingly and pro-active notify the user when something important happens.

It is exciting to think that it can also use bio feedback to determine the user's state and adjust the information accordingly. For example, if the user is stressed, it can filter out all the non-essential information and only notify the user when something important happens.
