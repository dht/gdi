# Augmented Reality

Adoption of VR and AR technologies has been slow. Apple's upcoming AR headset could change that. It is one of the most complex consumer electronic products ever built and has the potential to usher a new era of AR applications alongside its budget counterpart, the Oculus Quest 3.

## The Future of AR

Fields like interior design, architecture, and fashion were always considered a natural fit for AR. The ability to visualize and interact with virtual objects in the real world is a powerful tool for these industries.

As wide adoption of LLMs and AI tech continues, AR can become a natural extension of the AI-driven interfaces. The ability to interact with AI in the real world could prove to be a powerful tool for productivity and creativity.

## Scenarios for AI+AR Integration

- **Training**: AI+AR can be used to train people in real-time. For example, a surgeon can be trained by an AI assistant during a simulated surgery while wearing an AR set.

- **Engineering**: AI+AR can be used to help engineers visualize and interact with complex 3D models. Whether its complex molecules or architectural designs. Famous scenes from the sci-fi movie "Iron Man" come to mind where the main protagonist Tony Stark interacts engineering models in real-time while being assisted by an AI assistant named "Jarvis".

- **Education**: AI+AR can be used to enhance the learning experience. For example, a student can be assisted by an AI tutor while wearing an AR set.

- **Movie industry**: AI+AR can be used to create immersive experiences. For example, a movie director can use an AI assistant to create a virtual set and actors can interact with virtual objects in real-time.

- **Manage and control**: AI+AR can be used to manage and control complex systems. For example, a factory manager can use an AI assistant to monitor and control the factory in real-time.

These are just a few examples of how AI+AR can be used to enhance our lives. The possibilities are endless.
