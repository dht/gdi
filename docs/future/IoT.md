# Internet of Things (IoT)

Much like AR/VR and AI, IoT is another technology that has been around for a while but has yet to reach its full potential. The main reason for this is the lack of a unified platform that can connect all the different devices together.

## What is IoT?

IoT stands for the Internet of Things. It refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these things to connect and exchange data.

## The Future of IoT

Similar to AR/VR, a wide adoption of LLMs and AI tech can revolutionize the IoT industry. Models such as GPT4 which has the power to reason and make decisions can extend the reach of AI to the physical world and create a new generation of interfaces.

## Scenarios for AI+IoT Integration

- **Farming**: AI+IoT can be used to monitor and control farms. For example, a farmer can use an AI assistant to monitor and control the farm in real-time.

- **Art Installations**: AI+IoT can be used to create immersive experiences. For example, Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller "The Storm Room" is an art installation which transforms a room intro a room in a house being hit by a storm. It uses a computer to to control the lights, sounds, and other effects. This can be extended to create a more immersive experience in realtime using AI+IoT and perhaps customize it to the identities of the visitors.

- **Smart Cities**: AI+IoT can be used to monitor and control cities. For example, a city manager can use an AI assistant to monitor and control the city in real-time.
