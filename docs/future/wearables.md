# Other Wearables

As AI technology matures, it will be possible to create a new generation of interfaces that can be worn. It is already possible to embed AI models on edge devices such as mobile phones. A possible step is to create a new generation of interfaces that can be worn.

These interfaces can offer real-time feedback and can be used to enhance our lives in many ways. For instance, they can be used help us make better decisions.

## Wearable Ear Pods

Ear pods are an example of a simple IO device. They are small, portable, and would be able to leverage AI technology to offer exciting new capabilities.

### Use Cases

- **Psychology**: imagine a world where a therapist can wear an ear pod during a session and an AI assistant analyzes the conversation in real-time and provides feedback to the therapist. This can help the therapist to be more effective by enjoying the benefits of infinite memory and vast knowledge base - while still being able to focus on the patient. Topics such as patient privacy are to be addressed but can be tackled with obfuscation techniques.

- **Education**: imagine a world where a student can wear an ear pod during a lecture and an AI assistant analyzes the lecture in real-time and provides personalized explanations to the student.

These examples showcase a `Hybrid approach` to AI-human interaction where AI is used to augment human capabilities and interaction and not replace them.
