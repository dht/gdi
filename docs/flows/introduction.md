# Understanding Flows in GDI

Flows in GDI are fundamental components that orchestrate a series of AI API calls. They are conceptually similar to [chains](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/) in LangChain, where each flow represents a cohesive sequence of AI operations, connected through input and output parsers.

## Launching Mechanism

A flow is typically initiated by a user prompt. This is the catalyst that sets a flow run into motion, starting the sequence of AI operations defined in the flow.

## Output Formats

The output generated by a flow in GDI can be diverse, ranging from documents and images to audio files or structured data types like JSON. This flexibility allows flows to be tailored to a wide variety of tasks and outcomes.

## Flow Component in GDI

In the GDI user interface, flows are represented through a specific Flow component. This component visualizes the active phase of the flow, providing valuable real-time information such as:

- The current running time of the flow.
- Any potential errors encountered during the flow's execution.
- The cost implications and expected running time.

This graphical representation enhances the user's understanding and control over the flow, making the process transparent and manageable.

The above image is an example of how a Flow component might appear within a GDI board, illustrating the detailed and user-friendly interface design that characterizes GDI's approach.
