# Creating New Boards

## Setup Environment

Make sure you have the assets repository cloned locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:dht/gdi-assets.git
```

> The repo needs to be cloned as a sibling of the `gdi` repo. for example: `~/projects/gdi` and `~/projects/gdi-assets`

### Start the Sync Script

In the `gdi` repo, run the sync script:

```
npm run sync:boards
```

This will start a script that watches for changes in the boards located in `gdi/public/boards` and syncs them to the assets repo.

### Update the .env File

In the `gdi` repo, update the `.env.development` file with the following values:

```
VITE_BOARDS_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3000/boards
...
```

> Mobile: if you want to access the boards from a mobile device, you will need to update the `.env.development` file with your local IP address. For example: `VITE_BOARDS_ROOT_URL=http://192.0.10.20:3000/boards`

### Start the Development Server

In the `gdi` repo, start the development server:

```
npm start
```

## Structure

The `allBoards.json` file contains a list of all the boards. It is automatically generated by the sync script.

## Submitting the Changes

To submit the changes create a PR in the `gdi-assets` repo.
