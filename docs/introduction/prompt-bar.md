# Prompt Bar

At the bottom of the screen is the prompt bar, a universal input area that allows users to interact with the GDI ecosystem. It is designed to be a central hub for user interactions, providing a consistent and intuitive experience across boards.

Its common elements include:

- **Prompt Area**: Acts as a universal area for inputting prompts applicable across all boards. This centralizes user interactions, making it convenient to control and navigate the GDI ecosystem.
- **Instance Information**: Displays key details about the current GDI instance.
- **System Details**: Shows relevant system information, like screen resolution.

## Tag Selection Button

At the right side of the prompt bar is the tag selection button:

When you click it a tag selector will appear. The first tag you enter will be the project tag followed by any other tags you want to add. Each time you save an asset in any board on GDI, it will be tagged with all the tags you entered in the tag selector.

Project tags are used to organize assets by project. For example, if you are working on a project called `project-modelz` and you enter `project-modelz` in the tag selector you will get the following behavior:

1. **Saving assets**: All assets you save will be tagged with `project-modelz`.
2. **Browsing assets**: When you open the asset manager, you'll be automatically redirected to the `project-modelz` folder.
3. **Choosing assets**: Any board you open will automatically show you _ONLY_ assets tagged with `project-modelz`.

This contextual tagging system makes it easy to switch between projects and focus on the task at hand.
