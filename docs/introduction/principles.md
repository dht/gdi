# Core Principles

GDI is an ecosystem for building graphical user interfaces for the AI era. It is dedicated to exploring the future of AI-driven interfaces and redefining what is possible in this new era. GDI is built on the following core principles:

1. **Schema-Driven Design**: Entities within GDI are primarily JSON-based with straightforward schemas. This facilitates efficient management, version control, and adaptability across the ecosystem.

2. **GIT Integration**: Leveraging schemas allows for versioning and evolutionary development of user interfaces, integrating the robust capabilities of GIT into the realm of UI design.

3. **AI Provider Agnosticism**: GDI is fundamentally built to be provider-agnostic, enabling seamless swapping and integration of various AI flows.

4. **Simplified Automation**: By combining diverse tools and extensions, GDI streamlines the process of automation, making it more accessible and efficient.

5. **Cost Transparency**: GDI prioritizes clear cost impact assessments, aiming to provide pre-execution estimates. It balances cost-efficient models with more resource-intensive options.

6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Emphasizing robust logging, GDI captures detailed records of both backend and frontend operations, facilitating easy issue tracking and resolution.

7. **Run Clarity and Debugging**: Enhanced logging enables precise analysis and improvement of flow runs. Errors are contextualized, simplifying the debugging and inspection process.

8. **Rich Meta Information**: GDI maintains extensive metadata, including prompts and control parameters for assets and logs, enriching understanding and replicability of outputs.

9. **Asset Management Focus**: At its core, GDI places significant emphasis on effective asset management, featuring transient asset handling, tagging, project-based grouping, and streamlined sharing.

10. **Developer-Centric Tools**: With a focus on developer needs, GDI offers tools like VSCode extensions and JSON-based views, incorporating code-friendly interfaces and keyboard shortcuts.

11. **Device Agnosticism**: While currently web-focused, GDI aspires to extend its reach to mobile, VR, AR, and wearable technologies, embodying a device-agnostic philosophy.

12. **Collaborative Ecosystem**: GDI is committed to fostering a collaborative environment. It encourages community involvement and open-source contribution, aiming to build a robust, shared platform where developers can contribute, share, and benefit from collective advancements in AI and UI/UX design.

As a dynamic and forward-thinking project, GDI recognizes that its principles and methodologies will continually evolve. We are dedicated to exploring the ever-changing landscape of GUI in the AI era. Embracing innovation and adaptability, GDI is a fertile ground for new ideas and concepts.

We warmly invite new collaborators to join our journey. Whether you're a developer, designer, researcher, or enthusiast, your insights and contributions are valuable to us. GDI thrives on diverse perspectives and skills, and we believe that collective creativity is the key to pioneering the future of AI-driven user interfaces.
