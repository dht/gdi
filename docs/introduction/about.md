# About GDI

**GDI** (Graphical Development Interface) is an ecosystem for building graphical user interfaces for the AI era.

> Our mission is to create a new generation of interfaces and explore how these interfaces operate, look, and feel.

We start by finding GUI-oriented ways to simplify complex and repetitive tasks in AI workflows:

- **Asset Management**: Efficiently organizing and managing digital assets. Separate temporary and permanent assets.
- **Model Orchestration**: Chain management, make various AI models work together in a transparent and reliable way.
- **Data Management**: Enhancing the handling and processing of data within and between interfaces.
- **Cost Optimization**: Reducing operational costs while maximizing efficiency and clarity.

Our goal is not just to answer the question, "What will the user interfaces of the AI era look like?" but to actively define and create this future. GDI is dedicated to continuously redefining what is possible in the AI era.
