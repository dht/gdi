# Understanding Boards in GDI

Boards, or "Fusion Interfaces" are the core building blocks of the GDI ecosystem.

> A board is a single-screen application that serves as graphical user interfaces for a specific task.

Whether it is generating images, creating animations, or managing assets, each board is designed to offer the best possible experience in its domain. This section provides an overview of the different types of boards and their functionalities.

## A Hive of Boards

What sets GDI boards apart from traditional mobile or desktop applications is their interconnected nature. While some boards are self-sufficient, a board's true value often emerges from its interaction with other boards. This synergy is made possible by the shared database and asset library, allowing for seamless integration between boards.

### An Example of a Multi-Board Workflow

Let's consider an example to see this in action. Suppose you are creating a personalized 3D animated birthday wish for a friend. You could use the following boards:

1. **Writers Team**: Draft and refine the birthday wish, infusing personal touches and even stylistic elements, like mimicking the style of David Attenborough. The finalized text is saved.
2. **Voice Studio**: Transform the written wish into a captivating voice-over, styled akin to a National Geographic narrative.
3. **Image Generator**: Create a visually appealing background image featuring an African savanna.
4. **Asset Management**: Upload a photo of the friend to organize and tag for further use.
5. **Animation Studio**: Develop an engaging animation to accompany the voice-over and generate a shareable link for the friend.

This scenario exemplifies how the use of different boards can lead to creative and personalized outputs, showcasing the integrated nature of the GDI ecosystem.

## Utility Boards

Utility boards are a special category of boards that serve as a central repository for assets and other resources. "Asset Management" is an example of a utility board. It acts as a central repository where files created or used in other boards can be organized, tagged, and grouped by projects, making it easy to find and reuse assets.
