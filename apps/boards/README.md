AI is the new API

history of information:
2000s: Wikipedia, Google, YouTube, Facebook
2010s: Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter's rise, streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify
2020s: Tentative exploration into decentralized web and blockchain technology, with VR and AR technologies gradually emerging but not yet achieving mass adoption.
2023: AI revolution, no need for a human to digest multiple sources of information to produce knowledge

history of apps:
1990s: Icons on the OS
2000s: Gaming app stores: steam, xbox, playstation
2010s: Icons on the phone, App Store boom, mobile-first strategies, rise of on-demand services (like Uber, Airbnb)
2020s: Increase in voice-operated assistants and apps, while AR and VR apps gain interest but remain more niche. Super apps, offering a multitude of services within a singular platform, become more prevalent.
2023: AI revolution. Two major changes: Apps are no longer separated in containers, AI can serve as a glue between different apps. Apps are no longer a pre-baked experience. AI can offer dynamic flows and custom experiences and even interfaces based on user input.
